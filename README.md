# Kushal Reddy Singaram – Portfolio

This project was developed as part of my academic coursework focused on foundational web technologies. It demonstrates proficiency in HTML5 structure, semantic elements, and responsive layout techniques. The goal was to create a clean, accessible, and scalable portfolio page that serves as a personal introduction and a showcase for future projects.

## 🔍 Project Objectives

- ✅ Use of semantic HTML for clarity and SEO
- 📱 Mobile-first layout with responsive design principles
- 🧩 Organized codebase for maintainability and scalability
- 🚧 Placeholder sections for future CSS and JavaScript enhancements

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Git & GitHub

## 📁 Structure

- `index.html` – Main portfolio page
- `style.css` – Styling for layout, typography, and components
- Future enhancements planned for:
  - JavaScript interactivity
  - Theming and animations
  - Modular component structure

## Note: Use of AI in Development

AI tools were used minimally during the development of this project. The initial HTML structure was generated with the help of Gemini to establish a clean, semantic layout using foundational HTML5 elements. Additionally, styling suggestions—such as card-based layouts, gradient panels, and soft UI effects—were explored through AI-assisted brainstorming to refine the visual presentation.

Beyond layout and styling, AI was primarily used for proofreading and polishing written content throughout the README and documentation. All structural decisions, code organization, and responsive design techniques were implemented manually to reinforce learning and ensure full understanding of core web development principles using git, github and VS code.
